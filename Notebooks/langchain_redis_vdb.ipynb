BUSINESS\\nGENERAL\\nNIKE, Inc. was incorporated in 1967 under the laws of the State of Oregon.

NIKE is\\nthe largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products through NIKE Direct operations, which are comprised of both NIKE-owned retail stores\\nand sales through our digital platforms (also referred to as \"NIKE Brand Digital\"), to retail accounts and to a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales\\nrepresentatives in nearly all countries around the world. We also offer interactive consumer services and experiences through our digital platforms. Nearly all of our\\nproducts are manufactured by independent contractors. Nearly all footwear and apparel products are manufactured outside the United States, while equipment products\\nare manufactured both in the United States and abroad.\\nAll references to fiscal 2023, 2022, 2021 and 2020 are to NIKE, Inc.\\'s fiscal years ended May 31, 2023, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Any references to other fiscal\\nyears refer to a fiscal year ending on May 31 of that year.\\nPRODUCTS\\nOur NIKE Brand product offerings are aligned around our consumer construct focused on Men\\'s, Women\\'s and Kids\\'. We also design products specifically for the Jordan\\nBrand and Converse. We believe this approach allows us to create products that better meet individual consumer needs while accelerating our largest growth\\nopportunities.\\nNIKE\\'s athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use, although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes. We\\nplace considerable emphasis on innovation and high-quality construction in the development and manufacturing of our products. Our Men\\'s, Women\\'s and Jordan Brand\\nfootwear products currently lead in footwear sales and we expect them to continue to do so.\\nWe also sell sports apparel, which features the same trademarks and are sold predominantly through the same marketing and distribution channels as athletic footwear.'),\n",

Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those\\nin the second and third fiscal quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular\\ntypes of footwear, apparel and equipment, as well as other macroeconomic, strategic, operating and logistics-related factors.\\nBecause NIKE is a consumer products company, the relative popularity and availability of various sports and fitness activities, as well as changing design trends, affect\\nthe demand for our products. We must, therefore, respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new\\nproducts, styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing. Failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could\\nhave a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. This is a continuing risk. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.\\nOUR MARKETS\\nWe report our NIKE Brand operations based on our internal geographic organization. Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the\\ndesign, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. The Company\\'s reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North\\nAmerica; Europe, Middle East & Africa (\"EMEA\"); Greater China; and Asia Pacific & Latin America (\"APLA\"), and include results for the NIKE and Jordan brands.

Due to the high fixed-cost structure associated with our NIKE Direct retail stores, a decline in sales, a shift in consumer behavior away from brick-and-\\nmortar retail, or the closure, temporary or otherwise, or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of\\nequipment and leasehold improvements and employee-related costs.\\nMany factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond our control, pose risks and uncertainties. Risks include, but are not limited to: credit card fraud;\\nmismanagement of existing retail channel partners; inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation; and theft.\\nIn addition, we have made significant investments in digital technologies and information systems for the digital aspect of our NIKE Direct operations, and our digital\\nofferings will require continued investment in the development and upgrading of our technology platforms. In order to deliver high-quality digital experiences, our digital\\nplatforms must be designed effectively and work well with a range of other technologies, systems, networks, and standards that we do not control. We may not be\\nsuccessful in developing platforms that operate effectively with these technologies, systems, networks or standards.

Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign\\ncurrency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. Dollars.\\nOur foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of\\noperations, financial position and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks material to NIKE, Inc. We\\nmanage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations existing within the portfolio and, where practical and material, by hedging a\\nportion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the implementation of the NIKE Trading\\nCompany (\"NTC\") and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency\\ncorrelation benefits existing within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate\\nchanges on the underlying net exposures being hedged. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on\\nour Consolidated Financial Statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or\\nspeculative purposes.\\n2023 FORM 10-K 42'),\n",

NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.\\nb.Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those\\nNIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\\nIn both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.\\n2.Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign\\ncurrency risk by assuming certain of the factories\\' foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures.\\nUnder this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (\"factory currency exposure index\") in which the\\nlabor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (\"factory input costs\") are denominated.\\nAs an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening\\nU.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces NIKE\\'s U.S. Dollar inventory cost.

When\\nthe designated amount of anticipated or actual transactions decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the\\noriginally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, we reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of\\nthe related hedge contract from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Other (income) expense, net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES\\nABOUT  MARKET RISK\\nIn the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations\\nin the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such\\nexposures; we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes.\\nWe are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign exchange risk\\nmanagement program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and\\ncash flows. We use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated, but not yet firmly committed, transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the\\nrelated receivables and payables, including third-party and intercompany transactions. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of\\nexchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nThe timing for hedging exposures, as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed, are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon\\nthe nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted\\ntransaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The majority of derivatives outstanding as of\\nMay 31, 2023, are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro, Chinese Yuan/U.S. Dollar, and Japanese Yen/U.S.\\nDollar currency pairs. Refer to Note 12 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional\\ninformation.\\nOur earnings are also exposed to movements in short- and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of\\ninterest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans,\\nand fixed-rate debt of varying maturities.\\nMARKET RISK MEASUREMENT'),\n",

The Company makes ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of its accounts receivable\\nand maintains an allowance for expected losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. In addition to judgments about the\\ncreditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations, the Company considers historical levels of credit losses, as well as macroeconomic and\\nindustry trends to determine the amount of the allowance. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $35 million and $34 million as of May 31, 2023 and\\n2022, respectively.\\nINVENTORY VALUATION\\nInventories, substantially all of which are finished goods, are stated at lower of cost and net realizable value and valued on either an average or a specific identification\\ncost basis. In some instances, the Company ships products directly from its suppliers to the customer, with the related inventory and cost of sales recognized on a specific\\nidentification basis.

Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in\\nwhich an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the\\nobservable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, the Company would assess the recoverability of an asset group by\\ndetermining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of\\nthe assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not\\nrecoverable, the Company will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies, which would typically include an estimate of\\ndiscounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset group's carrying amount and its estimated fair value.\\nGOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS\\nThe Company performs annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when events occur or\\ncircumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value.\\nFor purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, the Company allocates goodwill across its reporting units, which are considered the Company's operating segments.

These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure\\nfor those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\\nThe Company's policy permits the utilization of derivatives to reduce its foreign currency exposures where internal netting or other strategies cannot be effectively\\nemployed. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental\\nhedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivatives designated as\\ncash flow hedges was $18.2 billion as of May 31, 2023.\\nAs of May 31, 2023, approximately $419 million of deferred net gains (net of tax) on both outstanding and matured derivatives in Accumulated other comprehensive\\nincome (loss) are expected to be reclassified to Net income during the next 12 months concurrent with the underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in Net\\nincome. Actual amounts ultimately reclassified to Net income are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts currently outstanding mature. As of\\nMay 31, 2023, the maximum term over which the Company hedges exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted transactions was 27 months.\\nFAIR VALUE HEDGES\\nThe Company has, in the past, been exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. Derivatives used by\\nthe Company to hedge this risk are receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. The Company had no interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges as of\\nMay 31, 2023.\\nNET INVESTMENT HEDGES\\nThe Company has, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge the risk of variability in foreign currency-denominated net investments in wholly-owned international\\noperations. All changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as net investment hedges are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) along with\\nthe foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments.

The total notional amount of\\noutstanding undesignated derivative instruments was $4.7 billion as of May 31, 2023.\\nCREDIT RISK\\nThe Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to hedging instruments. The counterparties to all derivative\\ntransactions are major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings; however, this does not eliminate the Company's exposure to credit risk with these\\ninstitutions. This credit risk is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted. To manage this risk, the\\nCompany has established strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored.\\nThe Company's derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features designed to protect against significant deterioration in counterparties' creditworthiness\\nand their ultimate ability to settle outstanding derivative contracts in the normal course of business. The Company's bilateral credit-related contingent features generally\\nrequire the owing entity, either the Company or the derivative counterparty, to post collateral for the portion of the fair value in excess of $50 million should the fair value of\\noutstanding derivatives per counterparty be greater than $50 million. Additionally, a certain level of decline in credit rating of either the Company or the counterparty could\\ntrigger collateral requirements. As of May 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all credit risk-related contingent features, and derivative instruments with such\\nfeatures were in a net liability position of approximately $2 million. Accordingly, the Company posted no cash collateral as a result of these contingent features. Further, as\\nof May 31, 2023, the Company had received $36 million in cash collateral from various counterparties to its derivative contracts. The Company considers the impact of the\\nrisk of counterparty default to be immaterial.\"),\n",
